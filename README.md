Fraud Analytics Projects
 
Hi, and welcome to my GitHub! I'm Rimsha Arbab Khan, a fraud analytics professional working alongside a fantastic team led by Saim. Over the past 4 years, I’ve been hands-on with several analytics and reporting initiatives focused on fraud detection, risk scoring, and operational insights.
 
This repository features projects where I contributed to development, testing, and data storytelling — all using Python, SQL, and Streamlit.
